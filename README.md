# Svelte website for EIP
Yes

## How to build

```
git clone https://github.com/Blackoutburst/EIP.git
cd EIP
switch import App from './App.svelte' in src/main.js to import App from '../Private/./App.svelte'
npm install

# Thanks to don't push **src/main.js** except if you want to modify the final website

I swear to god do not push **node_modules**
